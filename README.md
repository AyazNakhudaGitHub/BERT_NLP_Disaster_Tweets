# NLP_Disaster_Tweets

In this project, I was able to classify tweets from a Kaggle dataset as either disaster related or not. The natural language of the tweets was analyzed. Label encoding, tokenization and masking was also done. A LSTM model was implemented with L2 regularization and dropout to help improve validation results. I then implemented the BERT algorithm to see if validation results would improve. I was able to improve the validation score by 11%. I learned about algorithms which are used in industry to classify natural language text.
